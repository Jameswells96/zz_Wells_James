When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r Titanic}
#This is where I will work on Assignment 0
dataframe = data.frame(Titanic) #Passenger Breakdown
Child = dataframe[dataframe$Age=="Child",] #List of the children on the Titanic
Adult = dataframe[dataframe$Age=="Adult",] #List of the adults on the Titanic
sum(Child$Freq) #This sum function will display the total number of children on the Titanic
sum(Adult$Freq) #This sum function will display the total number of adults on the Titanic
sum(dataframe$Freq) # This sum function will display the total number of people on the Titanic

Male = dataframe[dataframe$Sex=="Male",] #List of adult males on the Titanic
Female = dataframe[dataframe$sex=="Female",] #List of adult females on the Titanic
if(sum(Male$Freq) > sum(Female$Freq)) {Gender = "Males"} else {Gender = "Females"}
print(Gender) #This if-else statement indicates that there were more males on the Titanic

ChildrenSurvived = dataframe[dataframe$child=="Yes", dataframe$survived=="Yes",] # making a list of the children who survived
sum(ChildrenSurvived$Freq)
head(Titanic)
